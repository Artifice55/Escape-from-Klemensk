Escape From Klemensk
Welcome to Escape From Klemensk, a Python game where survival is your only goal! In this game, you take on the role of Artyom, a survivor trapped in the midst of a city overrun by hordes of zombies. Your mission? Survive and escape from Klemensk at any cost!

How to Play

Objective: Your objective is to guide Artyom safely out of Klemensk while avoiding or neutralizing the zombies that roam the streets.

Movement: Use the 'WASD' keys to navigate Artyom through the city streets. Be cautious! Zombies lurk around every corner, and they hunger for your flesh.

Weapons and Items: Artyom can find weapons and items scattered throughout the city. Use the 'F' key to interact with objects and pick up items that might aid in your survival.

Combat: When you encounter a zombie, you'll need to fight for your life. Use the 'Spacebar' to attack with your equipped weapon. Be strategic and conserve your ammo and resources.

Health and Stamina: Keep an eye on Artyom's health and stamina meters. Engaging in combat and running will deplete your stamina, while sustaining injuries will reduce your health. Find first aid kits and food to replenish your health and stamina.
